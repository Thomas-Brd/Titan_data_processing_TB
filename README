Titan_data_processing_TB contains scripts and workflows developped by Thomas Bernard that aim to be used by anyone.
So before to use them please read this README file first to understand how it is structured.

There are two folders:
    - /scripts contains some scripts, module and functions.
    - /Workflows contains all workflows developed by Thomas Bernard used to process lidar data.

Here are some descriptions of the scripts:
 - classify_bathy.py : "This script allows to classify points located in rivers based on a C2C distance
                       from a water surface point cloud. Result: .laz files with a new SF "Classification"
                       with 1 and 9 for unclassified and bathy respectively."

Here are some descriptions of the workflows:
